        <p>At the exhibition, visitors will become acquainted with the event’s historical background, witness the events of the eve of the evacuation and the heat of battle, and reflect on the aftermath of the tragedy that persists to this day.
The exhibition focuses mainly on people’s stories and the naval mines that caused a lot of doom. Visitors can explore two ships that escaped from the evacuation – the submarine Lembit and the icebreaker Suur Tõll are part of the museum’s permanent exhibition.
